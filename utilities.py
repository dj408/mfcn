    Computes a same-size central moving average
    for a given vector, by shrinking the averaging
    window where there are not enough trailing/leading
    entries (i.e. at the array ends). Any given entry
    is replaced by the mean of the most possible adjacent
    entries, up to 'n_trail_lead' on both sides. Thus,
    the tails are noisier / less smoothed, but as the same
    size, the smoothed array can be easily plotted against 
    the original.

    Args:
        arr: vector of values.
        n_trail_lead: number of trailing and leading
            adjacent entries to average. Example: 
            n_trail_lead=50 means replacing a value
            with the mean of 101 values, where possible.
        boundary_strategy: parameter to deal with the
            boundary issue for central averaging: that vector
            elements near the head and tail can't average the
            same leading or trailing number of entries. One of:
            (1) 'look_inward', to preserve n_trail_lead
            averaging in the direction possible and maximize in the 
            other direction; 
            (2) 'shrink_n', to always average the same
            number of entries to the left and right of entries
            near the boundaries, by shrinking 'n_trail_lead';
            (3) 'wrap', to include elements from the opposite
            end of the array in order to satisfy 'n_trail_lead'
            on 'both sides' of each entry (this is applicable
            to periodic functions on an interval satisfied by
            'arr').
