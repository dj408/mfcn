# README

The code in this repository reproduces the numerical experiments found in the extended abstract "Convergence of Manifold Filter-Combine Networks." To use this code:

1. Set save paths and experiment parameters in the `config.py` file.
2. Run the main experiment script: `python3 convergence_experiment.py`
4. To reproduce the spectral filter and eigenvalue convergence plots, next run the plot creation script:`python3 make_convergence_plots.py`
